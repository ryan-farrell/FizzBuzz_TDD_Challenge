## notes and with Thanks to:

A work shop to introduce the basics of Test Driven Development (TDD) to a group of Junior Developers
as Code Nation in Manchester from [Codurance]https://codurance.com/2018/06/27/manchester-office/ from the 
presenter Liam "Gryff". 

Uploaded the finished project for posterioty as I've added some notes in my comments to review and further 
read up of other test libraries other than 'Jest' used in this example project.
